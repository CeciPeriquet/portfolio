## Hi, there! 👋

I'm still working on it, but here's my personal portfolio, where you can see a bit of what I've done and what can I do (but if you need any other thing, just let me know and I'll learn how to do it).

I´ve just finished a Development Bootcamp in Adalab (mainly Front-End but also a bit of Back-end)👾.

I used to work in tv 📺 (specially giving technical support on AVID software) and play in music bands 🎸.

I love to learn stuff and also teach others 🤓, that's why I feel so confortable in development, such a creative and supportive community ❤️ .

## 🔧 Tecnologies

I designed it on **Figma** (including the logo) and then developed it using **HTML5, SASS & REACT JS**.

The projects list info comes from a **.json** file, so I only have to add more projects to the json file, and React whould render the new project automatically.

Similar stuff for the _tech stack_ list, I'm using an array of technologies and then rendering it with a map method.

I'm whiling to add some cool animations using libraries such as **GSAP**.

## 📚 What did I learn

- How to draw in **Figma** and then export the logo file as an **svg** in order to be able to change it from Visual Studio Code (for example to change its color depending on the webside mode, oh! and yeah! **_IT BLINKS!_**).
- `CreateContext()`: had to add a Theme Provider in order to be able to change the website mode from light to dark.
- `react-switch`: that I use to swap modes. (I may change it for a CSS animation icons, who knows...)
- `react-icons`: I used to use icons from fontawesome, didn't know React had it's own.
- `window.scrollTo()`: giving it a smotth behaviour (for example on the arrow that appears when user scrolls down, in orther to go back to the top of the page again).
- `NavLinks` also have a **_smooth behaviour_**.
- Related to that I saw really interesting stuff like **_Locomotive Scroll_** or **_Smotth Scroll_** (GSAP) that I might apply later on.
